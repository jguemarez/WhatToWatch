# What to Watch?
## Description

When creating this project, we set out to create a website that allowed visitors to discovery new movies in a variety of genres, and where to watch them. By completing this assignment, we gained a better understanding of branch management on GitHub, as well as how to use Tailwind.

## Installation

## Usage

You can access the website here: [INSERT LINK HERE]

When you open this page, you will be presented with a screen that looks like this:

![The site in its base state upon opening](./assets/images/Base_Page.png)

From here, you can use the dropdown menu to select a movie genre of your choosing. This will present the user with a the movie list that only features movies that meet that classification. The dropdown menu is demonstrated below:

Another feature of the site is its use of modals. These modals will show you the streaming services where you can watch your movie of choice. Here is an example of one of these modals:

Lastly, the site also features a "My Favorites" toggle bar, that allows you to only display the movies that you deem as your favorite. This is done by simply clicking on the Favorites button. You can see both the button and the "My Favorites" toggle bar in action demonstrated here:

Here is the button turned off (it's base state)

And here is how the page looks after the "My Favorites" slider is activated.
